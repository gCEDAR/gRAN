## Introduction

GRANBase is an open source set of tools for testing and deploying `R`
packages as package repositories for both general deployment and
result reproduction. It is based on the `switchr` framework, and
allows users to deploy package manifests as validated repositories.It
is centered around the R repository mechanism for pacakge
distribution. GRANBase provides three major areas of functionality:

* The ability to create one or more `R` repositories by pulling and
  testing packages from diverse locations (scm, local directory), in a
  manner conducive to continuous integration
* Tools for recreating specific environments based on sessionInfos, and
  for creating lightweight virtual repositories which serve the exact package
  versions specified in the sessoinInfo
* Tools for assessing the potential impact of upgrading a package, to assist
  administrators in keeping systems up-to-date while protecting reproducibility
  and comparability of results in long-running core applications.

## Creating GRANBase repositories

GRANBase relies on the GRANCore framework for repository management,
which in turn is based on package manifests (*PkgManifest* or
*SeedingManifest* objects from the `switchr` framework).

Given a manifest, initial construction and rebuilding of individual
GRANBase repositories (referred to as _subrepositories_ because
GRANBase supports a form of branched deployment) is performed via the
`makeRepo` function. For example:

```{r init_granbase, include = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(GRANBase))
chooseCRANmirror(ind=1L)
options(error=traceback)
```

```{r makerepo, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, results = "hide", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = TRUE}
testpkgs <- list.files(system.file("testpkgs", package = "GRANBase"),
                       full.names = TRUE)
man <- PkgManifest(name = basename(testpkgs),
                  url = testpkgs, type = "local")
repdir <- file.path(tempdir(), "repos")
if(!file.exists(repdir)) dir.create(repdir)
repo <- makeRepo(man,
                repo_name= "stable",
                basedir = repdir,
                destination = repdir,
                cores = 1L,
                install_test = TRUE,
                check_test = FALSE)
```

*NOTE*: In the above code, we disabled the installation and `R CMD
 check`-related tests due to not playing well with the CRAN build
 system. In most cases, these should be `TRUE` in order to create a
 validated package repository. Also note that in the output below, the
 `willfail` package appears in the repository. This would not be the
 case if the check test was turned on, as it is engineered as a test
 case to fail check.

```{r availpkgs, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
available.packages(repo, type="source")
```

Note that the repository contains the package `GRANstable`. This was
generated automatically, and exports a `defaultGRAN()` function which
the `switchr` package will use when the package is loaded to
incorporate our package into the set of default repositories.

GRANBase represents (sub)repositories as `GRANRepository` objects,
which come from the `GRANCore` package. These objects contain all the
information required to build and deploy the repository.

Once a repository is created, its `GRANRepository` object is saved
within the created directory structure as the `repo.R` file. This
allows future builds to be invoked by the simpler syntax of passing a
`GRANRepository` object or path to a created repository to
`makeRepo()` directly:

```{r makestablerepo, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
repo <- makeRepo(file.path(repdir, "stable"), cores=1L)
```

The `makeRepo()` function also accepts a `build_pkgs` argument, which
will cause only the specified packages (and their reverse
dependencies) to be rebuilt, regardless of changes in version number.

```{r makestablerepo2, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
repo2 <- makeRepo(repo,
                  build_pkgs = basename(testpkgs)[1],
                  cores = 1L)
```


## The repository build process

GRANBase performs the following steps when creating or updating a
repository. At the end of each step, the packages' statuses are
updated to reflect the results of that step.

* Up-to-date copies of package sources are obtained for each package being built, including updating previously checked out versions
* Packages whose versions have changed since their last successful build, or who are reverse dependencies of such a package, are built without vignettes into a temporary repository via `R CMD build`.
* Packages which successfully built, along with their GRANBase, `CRAN`, and `Bioconductor`-based dependencies, are installed into a temporary library location.
* Packages which successfully installed are built again, with vignettes, into a staging directory.
* Remaining packages are tested via `R CMD CHECK`, and their statuses are updated accordingly
* Packages which meet the requirements set for the repository (`CHECK` warnings and notes can be all owed, or not) are deployed into the final destination repository
* The GRANBase manifest is updated to reflect the build results
* An HTML build report is generated from the updated manifest
* The manifest and `GRANRepository` object are saved
* The `GRANRepsitory` object is returned


## Clearing temporary artifacts

In order to get a clean slate  we can clear the repository, which will empty it completely (optionally excluding the code checkouts) via `clear\_repo` or we can clear just temporary files without wiping the recorded results with `clear\_temp\_files`.

```{r clear, echo=TRUE}
repo2 <- clear_temp_files(repo, checkout = FALSE, logs = FALSE)
repo2 <- clear_repo(repo2, checkout = TRUE)
repo_results(repo2)
```

We can then build the repo again using the expected machinery.

```{r makeagain, echo=TRUE}
repo3 <- makeRepo(repo, install_test = FALSE, check_test = FALSE)

```


## Tools for managing repository stability

GRANBase also provides tools to navigate the tension between stability
and using the most up-to-date version of packages to have the latest
bug fixes available.

The `identifyRisk` function identifies which currently installed
packages can be updated, and determines the packages that could
possibly be affected by updating the package. In particular, the
function allows the user to identify a vector of _important_ packages
and assesses the risks to each of them (by default, it takes that to
be the full set of installed packages).

_Risk_ here has a dual meaning. On the one hand updating a package
which an important package depends on incurs the risk of changing the
important package's behavior, potentially changing results in a
critical application. On the other hand, not updating a such a package
may leave important bug fixes un-applied, drawing the results
generated when using the important package into question.

`buildRiskReport` builds an HTML report which lists information about
each package with an update available in an easy to digest table. It
also provides a list of specific risks to each important package
(packages with no risks identified are currently omitted).
